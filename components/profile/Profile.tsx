                <p>A New Jersey native, Aalap moved with his parents to their
                    hometown in India. He spent his college years working in the
                    local textile manufacturing sector.

                then spent time at Marley Spoon. Here he was tasked with
                building out a just-in-time vendor model to support their
                explosive growth.

                their products into Target and other major retail chains.
